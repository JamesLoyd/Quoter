# Quoter

## Features to add
- scrub the usernames in a quote, so it wont ping people
- add a method to remove quotes, based on mod roles
- add a "no quote" text phrase that will block the quoter from sniping a quote

## Technical TODO
- Wire up database and migrations :)
- find a good # of quotes to store, pop off the last ones
- restrict quotes to channels ?
